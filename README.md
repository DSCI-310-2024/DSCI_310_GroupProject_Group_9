## Project Summary
At the heart of our exploration lies the vibrant, dynamic world of New York City's Airbnb landscape. Our project dives into the rich dataset detailing Airbnb's listing activity and metrics within NYC for the year 2019. Through our analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and insights into the hosts' world, geographical distribution of listings, and the underlying factors driving the popularity and pricing strategies across different neighborhoods.
